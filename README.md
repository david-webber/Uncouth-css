# Uncouth-css
Another classless CSS library.

Slowly putting together a CSS library, feel free to contribute.

[Demo](https://david-webber.github.io/Uncouth-css/)

Two scripts have been added to the package.json file to compile sass with default src and destination parameters:

Compile the sass using
`npm run compile`

Watch & compile sass changes with
`npm run watch`
